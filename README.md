CHALLENGES FACED

Q4 .Age Calculator:
Calculating exact age in years, months and days without using datetime library was tricky. Solved it using simple subtraction and adjusting when month or day difference becomes negative.

Q19.Text Analysis:
Building the word frequency dictionary without using any special methods was challenging. Solved it by manually checking if word already exists in dictionary and updating count.

I have referred to Python course materials for understanding the logic before writing the code.
